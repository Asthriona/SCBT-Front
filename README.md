This is the official Bug Tracker for Stellar Corporation.
This is a fairly new project, and is made to be usable by Customer, User and Staff.  
We will keep track of our bugs here in a "semi-public" manner. 
This means, when a bug is reported, depending on the project and the nature of the bug, Users will eb able to see it without login. 
if a user is logged in and happen to be part of one of our customer company, they will be able to see all bugs related to their product. 

Or for example, we are tracking a bug on Yukiko, you should be able to see (limited) information about this bug, and how far we are in the development of a patch.
Some information/comments may be hidden. 

The goal is to allow users to discuss with us of Features/Bugs in the future. 
But to be able to discuss with us on this platform, Users have to have a GitHub account. 

The same way, Security report may be done using this platform instead of ***Discord***. 

We (Stellar Corporation) are dedicated to make our own tools, and separate as much of our workflow from ***Discord***.
